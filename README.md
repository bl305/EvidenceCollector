EvidenceCollector

A tool to safely collect remote system evidences.

It is written in Python, but it can be converted to Windows executable using PyInstaller.
Later on I might put here compiled files also.

This tool is a server client tool using client and server side certificate based authentication. Once authenticated, 
the server can send commands, send files or retrieve files from the remote host.
